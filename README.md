# k8s-node-proxy

A lightweight proxy server that automatically discovers Kubernetes NodePort services and forwards traffic to current cluster nodes.

## The Problem This Solves

In Kubernetes environments, **NodePort services** expose applications on a static port (30000-32767) across all cluster nodes. However, accessing these services presents challenges:

### üîç **Dynamic Node IPs**
- **GKE node IPs change** during cluster autoscaling, upgrades, or maintenance
- **Direct node access** requires constantly updating IP addresses in applications
- **LoadBalancer services** work but add cost and complexity for internal tools

### üéØ **Development & Internal Tools**
- **CI/CD pipelines** need stable endpoints to run tests against NodePort services
- **Internal applications** require predictable URLs for service-to-service communication
- **Development environments** need consistent access points that survive cluster changes

## How k8s-node-proxy Solves This

k8s-node-proxy acts as a **stable gateway** that sits outside your Kubernetes cluster and automatically:

1. **üîç Discovers NodePort services** in your target namespace via Kubernetes API
2. **üì° Monitors cluster nodes** and their health status continuously
3. **üîÑ Routes traffic intelligently** to healthy nodes with automatic failover
4. **‚ö° Provides static endpoints** that never change regardless of cluster state

### Architecture Flow
```
External Client ‚Üí k8s-node-proxy:30001 ‚Üí healthy-node-ip:30001 ‚Üí NodePort Service ‚Üí Pod
```

### Key Benefits
- **üéØ Stable URLs**: Access `proxy-vm:30001` instead of `changing-node-ip:30001`
- **üîÑ Automatic failover**: Routes around unhealthy nodes (45-second max failover)
- **üìä Real-time monitoring**: Web UI shows cluster status, node health, and service discovery
- **üõ°Ô∏è Namespace isolation**: Scoped to specific namespace to avoid port conflicts
- **‚öôÔ∏è Zero configuration**: Auto-discovers everything through Kubernetes API

## Setup

### Option 1: Manual Setup
1. **Deploy on Google Cloud VM** with proper service account permissions (see Requirements below)
2. **Set environment variables**:
   - `PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project` or `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project`
   - `NAMESPACE=your-target-namespace`
3. **Run**: `./k8s-node-proxy`

### Option 2: Automated GCP Deployment
See [deployment/gcp/README.md](deployment/gcp/README.md) for VPC-only deployment scripts.

The proxy will:
- Discover all NodePort services in the specified namespace
- Start listeners on those ports
- Forward traffic to current cluster nodes automatically

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `PROJECT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: GCP project containing the GKE cluster
- `NAMESPACE`: Kubernetes namespace to discover NodePort services from

### Optional Environment Variables
- `PROXY_SERVICE_PORT`: Port for the management interface (default: 80)

## Requirements

### Google Cloud Permissions
The application requires a Google Cloud VM with a service account having the following IAM roles:
- **`roles/container.viewer`**: To discover GKE clusters, access cluster metadata, and list services
- **Network access**: VM must be able to reach the GKE cluster API server

### Runtime Dependencies
- **GKE cluster**: Must be in the same GCP project as the VM
- **Google Application Default Credentials (ADC)**: Automatically available on GCP VMs
- **Go 1.24+**: Only required for building from source

### Network Requirements
- VM must have network connectivity to the GKE cluster API server
- Outbound HTTPS access to Google Cloud APIs (container.googleapis.com)
